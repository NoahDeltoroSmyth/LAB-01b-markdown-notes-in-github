<h1>Tues. Aug. 24th, 2021</h1>

+Two labs today

+ One was creating a NameTag (the next day we created an interactive button and input option)

+ One was creating a basic html webpage about our favorite thing. I created mine about Jules and Elko. Looking back I can create an even better page, just from being in the class a couple more days. (writing this on the 26th)

+ Also, had about 30-60 min presentation about the program as a whole. They broke it down from 1st half to 2nd and the career week right in the middle. They told us we should start considering oursselves a software developer after our the completion of our first application.
